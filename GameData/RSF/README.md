## Known Issues:

- [] "DMagic Orbital Science" is incompatible with LRTR's Kerbalism Config  
- [] "OhScrap!" overlaps with Kerbalism functionality
- [] SXT LV-405 Vanguard still has Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer for its additional RCS engine 
- [] "Restock" Oscar B tank volumes are inconsistent with the stock one
  
 
## To Do
 
- [] Write installation instructions: 
	- [] Dependencies: 
		- [] Kerbalism -> Kerbalism LRTR Config
	- [] Configuration:
		- [] Turn off Real Fuels or Kerbalism ignition limit
- [] Make "DMagic Orbital Science" compatible with LRTR's Kerbalism Config  
- [] Suggest more configuration options for "OhScrap!" to turn of some functionality
- [] Move Airplane parts (Stock and from mods) around in the Tech Tree (mainly earlier)
- [] [SXT LV-405 Vanguard](https://github.com/linuxgurugamer/SXTContinued/blob/master/GameData/SXT/Parts/Rocketry/Engine/Vanguard/X405.cfg) still has Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer for its additional RCS engine -> write patch and submit it to RealFuels-Stock 
- [] Fix Oscar B tank volumes: https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/196996-real-world-sci-fi-mod-collection/&do=findComment&comment=3862324
- [] Make sure there are ullage motors available early in the tech tree
